## Description
How do we use data from the past to predict a better future for Canberra? Connect our citizens with their environment? We believe that predicting a better future for Canberra starts with appreciating what we currently have. The ACT Roads Wall Art project helps connect our citizens to our local environment by turning a piece of every day Canberra - our transport road networks - into a beautiful piece of wall art that acts as a reminder of a piece of infrastructure that connects us all.
